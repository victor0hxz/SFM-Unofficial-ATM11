## Features

- **Syntax highlighting:** For SFM code, similar to in-game text editor (well, a bit of a lie, not exact same colors).
Colors depends on the theme you are using

- **Tooltips:** Show a brief description of what that keyword does and some examples, at least 1. Hover over a keyword to discover

- **Snippets:** Basic functionalities that improves code writing, like every snippet or energy snippet.
For now, the following snippets are available: basic, energy, input, output, if, ifelse, ifelseif, every.

- **Folding:** You can hide collapse some structures on your files, like if or every

- **Activity bar:** To activate it, you need to open a workspace folder and then open a .sfm or .sfml. It includes examples, both in-game and from github. Requires Internet connection.

- **Error checking:** It will check the file when saved to check on any erros

- **Warnings:** It will show any input that has no output and viceversa. It might not work as well in some cases (check the changelog)

- **Share your work with others:** Activity bar has now a third tab for external urls (only GitHub and only .sfml and .sfm and folders) and local folders

- **Settings:** Customizations! You can add more content or change some behaviors from the default ones

- **Markdown:** On a markdown file, you can get almost all effect from the extension, except snippets

### 4. Start adding

By now, you have almost everything to start, just need some imagination.
We made some changes on the generated files to make it compile. Just 2 small changes because of `@lexer::members {
    public boolean INCLUDE_UNUSED = false; // we want syntax highlighting to not break on unexpected tokens
}` on the .g4

### 5. Pull request

Make a pull request to the original repo. Make sure it doesnt break anything that was before.
