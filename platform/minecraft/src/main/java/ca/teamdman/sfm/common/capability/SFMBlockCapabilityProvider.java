/// In NeoForge for Minecraft before 1.20.3, capabilities are queried from {@link BlockEntity}.
/// We wrap retrieved capabilities in {@link SFMBlockCapabilityResult}.
/// Capabilities are queried using a {@link SFMBlockCapabilityKind} like {@link SFMWellKnownCapabilities#ITEM_HANDLER}.
///
/// In Minecraft 1.20.3 and later, capabilities are instead queried from {@link Level}.
/// Additionally, mods can participate in the registration of capabilities to blocks in that version.
///
/// Prior to this version, for SFM to get a {@link SFMWellKnownCapabilities#FLUID_HANDLER} for {@link CauldronBlock},
/// it has its own mechanism for indirection via {@link SFMGlobalBlockCapabilityProviders} and {@link SFMBlockCapabilityProviderDiscovery}
